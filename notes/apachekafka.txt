apache kafka is a distributed streaming platform it allows u to publish or subscribe to streams of records,similar 
to the messaging system..one hand u can send and other hand u can consume that message..

because we need a distributed platform that can process all the data in paralle and you can also send data easily
 and retrieve data on the other end..



 apache kafka has three main component ..they are producer,consumer and broker
producers are the source of the data pushing the records into the data..
consumers are the people that consume the data to do something about it,basically to take action
