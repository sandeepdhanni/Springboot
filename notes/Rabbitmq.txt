rabbitmq:


rabbit mq is a message broker that originally implements the abvance message queing protocol(AMQP)
RabbitMQ is an open-source message broker software that facilitates communication between distributed
 systems. It implements the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP), making it highly reliable,
 efficient, and suitable for asynchronous messaging in distributed architectures.

AMQP(Advanced Message Queuing Protocol) standadizes messaging using producers,broker and consumers.
producers will publish the message.broker will hold the message and consumers will consume the 
message...
KEY FEATURES:
security : support authentication,authorization,LDAP and TLS via Rabbitmq plugins.
reliability: lets assume publisher will publish the message to the broker and consumer
will consume the message from broker.so there will be a two way communication..once the publisher
will confirm the message it will confirm that it is successfully delivered to the broker.and once 
consumer willl consume  the message again it will confirm that the message was successfully deliverd 
by consumer
interoperability: message is transfered as a stream of bytes so any clients can operate on it irrespective
of any other language..
