Mutable and Immutable in Python

When you create a variable and assign a value to it, Python stores that value in memory. If you later create another variable with the same name but a different value, Python creates a new object in memory and updates the variable name to reference this new object. The old object is removed automatically by Python’s garbage collector if it is no longer referenced.
Immutable objects are those whose value cannot be changed once created. If you try to modify an immutable object, Python will create a new object in memory instead of updating the existing one.
Mutable objects, on the other hand, can be changed in place without creating a new reference.
