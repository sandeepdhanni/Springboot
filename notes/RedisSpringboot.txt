REDIS -
it is an open source in-memory data store used by millions if developers as a cache,document database,streaming engine and message broker.

*  in-memory - means that the data is stored directly in the main memory (RAM) of a computer rather than on a disk..It allows very fast access to data because accessing RAM is much faster than reading from a disk.The data stored in RAM will take nano seconds to access and in disks(HHD OR SSD) will take millis seconds..



NOTE :
we mainly use cache to reduce the round-trip our application to database because it may lead to performance issues..for each request if i hit to database then it may lead to performance issue..to avoid that we use caching mechanism so that on my first request all the data from database will load to the redis cache so that when user trigger the second request...instead of going the request to database it will load the data from the cache itself..
